                    <h2> Ray Optics </h2>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    Like all the different types of light, the spectrum of visible light is absorbed and emitted in the
                    form of tiny packets
                    of energy called photons. These photons have both the properties of a wave as well as a particle.
                    Hence this type of property is called wave-particle duality and the study of light in the area of
                    physics is known as
                    Optics.
                    ptics is a branch of physics that deals with the determination of behaviour and the properties of
                    light, along with its
                    interactions with the matter and also with the instruments which are used to detect it.
                    Optics, in a simple manner, is used to describe the behaviour of visible light, infrared light, and
                    ultraviolet. Imaging
                    is done with the help of a system called an image forming an optical system.
                    Ray optics is also called geometrical optics. It is a branch of science that describes light
                    propagation in terms of
                    ‚Äúrays‚Äù.
                    <h3>Light And Its Optical Properties</h3>
                    Light is a form of energy that is in the form of an electromagnetic wave and is almost everywhere
                    around us. The visible
                    light has wavelengths measuring between 400‚Äì700 nanometres. The Sun is the primary source of light
                    by which plants
                    utilize this to produce their energy.
                    In physics, the term light also refers to electromagnetic radiation of different kinds of
                    wavelengths, whether it is
                    visible to the naked eye or not. Hence, by this, the gamma rays, microwaves, X-rays, and radio waves
                    are also types of
                    light. Learn more by visiting the links below.
                    ‚Ä¢ Gamma rays
                    ‚Ä¢ Microwaves
                    ‚Ä¢ X-rays
                    ‚Ä¢ Radio waves
                    Light exhibits various properties which are given below:
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    Reflection is one of the primary properties of light. Reflection is nothing but the images you see
                    in the mirrors.
                    Reflection is defined as the change in direction of light at an interface in-between two different
                    media so that the
                    wave-front returns into a medium from which it was originated. The typical examples for reflection
                    of light include
                    sound waves and water waves.
                    Speed of light
                    The rate at which the light travels in free space is called the Speed of light. For example, the
                    light travels 30%
                    slower in the water when compared to vacuum.
                    <h3>Refraction</h3>
                    The bending of light when it passes from one medium to another is called Refraction. This property
                    of refraction is used
                    in a number of devices like microscopes, magnifying lenses, corrective lenses, and so on. In this
                    property, when the
                    light is transmitted through a medium, polarization of electrons takes place which in turn reduces
                    the speed of light,
                    thus changing the direction of light.
                    <h3>Total Internal Reflection (TIR) </h3>
                    When a beam of light strikes the water, a part of the light is reflected, and some part of the light
                    is refracted. This
                    phenomenon is called as Total internal reflection.
                    <h3>Dispersion</h3>
                    It is a property of light, where the white light splits into its constituent colours. Dispersion can
                    be observed in the
                    form of a prism.
                    The other properties of light include diffraction and interference. So, what do you observe when you
                    look out at the
                    beautiful scenario? Whether the light gets reflected, dispersed, refracted, internally reflected, or
                    diffracted.

                    <h2> Optical Instruments</h2>
                    Optical instruments are the devices which process light wave to enhance an image for a more clear
                    view. The use of
                    optical instruments, such as a magnifying lens or any complicated device like a microscope or
                    telescope, usually makes
                    things bigger and helps us to see in a more detailed manner. The use of converging lenses makes
                    things appear larger,
                    and on the other hand, diverging lenses always get you smaller images.
                    While using a converging lens, it‚Äôs important to remember that, if an object is at a larger distance
                    than the image is
                    diminished and will be very nearer to the focal point. While the object keeps on moving in the
                    direction of the lens,
                    the image moves beyond the focal point and enlarges. When the object is placed at 2F, which is two
                    times the focal
                    distance from the lens, the image and object become of the same size. When the object moves from 2F
                    towards the focal
                    point (F), its image keeps moving out of the lens and enlarges till it goes to infinity when the
                    object reaches the
                    focal point, F. As the object moves closer to the lens, the image moves in the direction of the lens
                    from negative
                    infinity and gets smaller when the object gets closer to lens.
                    <h3>Applications of Optical Instruments:</h3>
                    <h3>Multiple Lenses: </h3>
                    There are many devices like telescopes and microscopes, which use multiple lenses to create images.
                    Analyzing any system
                    having multiple lenses shows that it works in stages where each lens forms an image of the object.
                    The original object
                    will work as the object for the first lens and creates an image. This new image will be the object
                    for the second lens
                    and so on. You can see this with these examples.
                    <h3>Microscope: </h3>
                    A microscope has two converging lenses. This is because it is easier to get higher magnification
                    with two lenses rather
                    than just one. Use of one lens can magnify 5 times more and using a second will magnify 7 times, and
                    you will get an
                    overall magnification of 35 which is not possible in one lens. It‚Äôs an easy procedure than to get
                    magnification by a
                    factor of 35 with a single lens. A ray diagram of the microscope arrangement is given below. Here
                    you can see the image
                    is the object for the second lens and the image formed by the second lens is the image that you
                    would see when you
                    looked through the microscope.
                    <h3>Telescopes: </h3>
                    As we use a telescope to view an object that is a very distant place, therefore, a telescope needs
                    at least two lenses.
                    The first lens forms a diminished image which is nearer to its focal point. This device is designed
                    in a way so that
                    real and inverted image formed by the first lens is just nearer to the second lens than its focal
                    length. With the help
                    of a magnifying glass, we get an enlarged image that is virtual. The final image then inverted with
                    respect to the
                    object. This doesn‚Äôt really matter with the astronomical telescope. While observing an object which
                    is on earth, we
                    usually prefer a straight image that is obtained using the third lens.

                    <h2> WAVE OPTICS </h2>
                    Wave optics also called Physical optics deals with the study of various phenomena such as
                    polarization, diffraction,
                    interference and other occurrences where ray approximation of geometric optics cannot be done. Thus,
                    the section of
                    optics that deals with the behaviour of light and its wave characteristics is said to be wave
                    optics.
                    In wave optics, the approximation is carried out by using ray optics for the estimation of the field
                    on a surface.
                    Further, it involves integrating ray-estimated field over a mirror, lens or aperture for the
                    calculation of the
                    scattered or transmitted field. We will learn about the concept of wave optics for IIT JEE in detail
                    here.
                    <h3>Wave Optics Theories</h3>
                    Wave optics stands as a witness for a famous standoff between two great scientific communities who
                    dedicated their lives
                    to understanding the nature of light. One supports the particle nature of light; the other supports
                    the wave nature.
                    Sir Isaac Newton stands as a prominent figure that supported the voice of particle nature of light,
                    who proposed a
                    corpuscular theory which states that ‚Äúlight consists of extremely light and tiny particles known as
                    corpuscles which
                    travel with very high speeds from the source of light to create a sensation of vision by reflecting
                    on the retina of the
                    eye‚Äù.
                    Using this theory Newton was able to explain reflection and refraction but failed to explain the
                    cause of interference,
                    diffraction and polarization. The major failure of Newton‚Äôs corpuscular theory was that it could not
                    explain why the
                    velocity of light was lesser in the denser medium compared to vacuum.

                    <h3>Principle of Superposition</h3>
                    This principle is applicable whenever there are multiple sources of light illuminating a particular
                    point. There lies an
                    interference term to the sum of the individual intensities whenever we consider the intensity of
                    light due to its point
                    sources. But this source works when they have the same frequency and have stability in the phase
                    difference.
                    <h3>Plane Polarised light</h3>
                    The light which gets emitted from a polaroid is called polarised light which means, it only
                    transmits one component of
                    light the one which is parallel in nature. Two maxima and minima can be seen when there a second
                    polaroid having an axis
                    turn of 2œÄ
                    is used to view the light. Polarised light can also be seen when reflected at the Brewster angle and
                    by scattering
                    through œÄ/2
                    in the atmosphere of the earth.
                    <h3>Properties of waves</h3>
                    Waves when released from a point source, scatters in all directions, but the light is seen to be
                    travelling in narrow
                    rays. All the aspects and behaviour of light has been explained in the experiments of Fresnel,
                    Young, and Huygens.
                    According to Young‚Äôs experiment, the key feature about the wave is the interference of amplitude
                    occurring due to
                    various sources and can be constructive and destructive in nature.
                    The limit of the ability of a microscope and telescopes of differentiating small objects is defined
                    by the wavelength of
                    the light. The limits of ray optics are defined by diffraction.
                    The polarisation phenomena are specific to light waves or transverse waves but interference and
                    diffraction also occur
                    for longitudinal waves such as the sound waves in air.

                    <h3>Huygens Wave Theory</h3>
                    No one dared to challenge Newton‚Äôs corpuscular theory until Christopher Huygens proposed his wave
                    theory of light in the
                    early 18th century. According to Huygens‚Äôs theory, light consists of waves that travel through a
                    very dilute and highly
                    elastic material medium present everywhere in space‚Äù. This medium is called ether.
                    As the medium is supposed to be very dilute and highly elastic, its density would be very low and
                    modulus of elasticity
                    would be very high so that the speed of the light would be very large.
                    Huygens wave theory was able to explain phenomena like reflection, refraction, interference, and
                    diffraction of light.
                    But failed to explain:
                    <ol>
                         <li>Polarization as Huygens assumed light waves to be mechanical disturbances which are
                              longitudinal in nature.
                         </li>
                         <li>Black body radiation, photoelectric effect and Compton Effect.</li>
                         <li>Hypothetical medium ether which was never discovered and now we know light can propagate in
                              a vacuum.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions on Optics</h2>
                    <h3>What is ‚ÄòSuperposition‚Äô? </h3>
                    The superposition principle states that when two or more waves overlap in space, the resultant
                    disturbance is equal to
                    the algebraic sum of the individual disturbances.
                    <h3>What is the ‚ÄòHuygen‚Äôs Principle‚Äô? </h3>
                    Huygens principle states that every point on a wavefront is in itself the source of spherical
                    wavelets. The sum of these
                    spherical wavelets forms the wavefront.
                    <h3>What are the properties of waves? </h3>
                    There are many properties that scientists use to describe waves. They include amplitude, frequency,
                    period, wavelength,
                    speed, and phase.

                    <h2> DUALNATURE OFMATTER</h2>

                    Dual nature of matter is an important concept in JEE physics and is basically the study of different
                    nature that a
                    matter possesses or exhibits. A matter can either display or have a particle nature or wave nature.
                    Various experiments
                    have further been conducted to prove this theory.
                    Initially, the properties of matter or light were explained in terms of its particle nature.
                    Corpuscular theory of
                    light, etc. were some of the primitive steps that influenced this. Later on, it was experimentally
                    found out that matter
                    does possess the properties of a wave. Hence, the matter is said to possess dual nature, i.e., it
                    has both the
                    properties of a particle and as well as a wave.
                    Maxwell‚Äôs equation of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on the generation and detection of
                    electromagnetic waves in
                    1887 strongly established the wave nature of light.
                    Thus, the wave-particle duality is an important concept in quantum mechanics which describes that
                    every particle or more
                    specifically quantum entity may be expressed as either a particle or a wave. This concept further
                    helps to modify the
                    inability of the classical mechanic‚Äôs approach or theories to fully describe the behaviour of the
                    matter.
                    <h3>Important Topics Covering Dual Nature of Matter</h3>
                    Here are some of the important topics that should be learnt while dealing with this concept.
                    <h3>Electronic Emission</h3>
                    The minimum energy that is required to emit an electron from the surface of a metal can be supplied
                    to the free
                    electrons by either of the methods given below:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Thermionic Emission: Required thermal energy is provided to the free electrons by suitably
                              heating it so as to
                              enable them to come out of the metal. </li>
                         <li>Field Emission: Electrons are kept under the strong influence of the electric field to emit
                              the electron out of
                              the metal. </li>
                         <li>Photo-electric Emission: When the light of appropriate frequency is made to illuminate a
                              metal surface,
                              electrons are emitted from it. These photo-generated electrons are called Photoelectrons.
                         </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Photoelectric Effect</h3>
                    The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon that involves electrons escaping from the surface of
                    materials. Usually, the
                    surface of the material is composed of both positive and negative ions. What happens in the process
                    is when light is
                    made to be incident on the metal surface, some of the electrons which are present near the surface
                    will absorb enough
                    energy from the incident radiation and thus overcomes the attraction of the positive ions. Further,
                    when the electrons
                    gain as much sufficient energy required, they will escape out of the metal surface into the
                    surrounding space. This
                    forms the basis for the Photoelectric effect.
                    Some related terms include:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Work Function: The minimum energy that is required to eject an electron from a metal
                              surface. </li>
                         <li>Threshold Frequency: The minimum frequency of light that can force an electron to emit from
                              a metal surface.
                         </li>
                         <li>Threshold Wavelength: The maximum wavelength of light that can eject a photoelectron from
                              the surface of a
                              metal. </li>
                    </ul>
                    If, Work Function is denoted by ∆ü, Threshold Frequency by f, and Threshold Wavelength by ∆õ; then we
                    have ∆ü = hf =hc/ ∆õ;
                    where h is Planck‚Äôs Constant. E=hf
                    <h3>Concepts to understand: </h3>
                    Cut-off Potential: The minimum negative or retarding potential V0 given to a plate for which
                    photoelectric current
                    becomes zero is called Cut-off or Stopping Potential.
                    Effect of Intensity of incident light is linear with the photoelectric current for a fixed incident
                    frequency as
                    depicted in Figure 1 given below.
                    Effect of Potential on Photoelectric Current is that it increases with increase in Potential applied
                    to the collector
                    for a fixed frequency and intensity of incident light, and finally attains maximum current termed as
                    Saturation Current.
                    <h3>Laws Of Photoelectric Effect</h3>
                    The laws of the Photoelectric effect are as follows:
                    <ol>
                         <li> For a given metal and frequency of incident light, the photoelectric current is directly
                              proportional to the
                              intensity of incident light. </li>
                         <li> For a given metal, there is a certain minimum frequency, called Threshold frequency, below
                              which there is no
                              photo-electric emission. </li>
                         <li>The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons above a threshold frequency depends upon the
                              frequency of incident
                              light. </li>
                         <li> The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>De Broglie Hypothesis</h3>
                    With respect to Quantum theory of matter, De Broglie postulated the relationship between momentum
                    and wavelength.
                    Mathematically, it is given in the form, wavelength ∆õ = h/P; where P is the momentum of the particle
                    under study and h
                    is Planck‚Äôs Constant.
                    <h3>De Broglie-Bohm Theory</h3>
                    De Broglie-Bohm Theory, which is also called as Bohmian Mechanics considers the wave nature
                    predominates and thus the
                    particle-wave duality goes vanished. It explains wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance
                    as the particle‚Äôs
                    expression is subjected over to a guiding equation or quantum potential.
                    <h3>Derivation Of De Broglie Equation</h3>
                    hf=mc2
                    We know that the frequency f=c/ ∆õ
                    It implies that hc/ ∆õ=mc2 or ∆õ = h/mc
                    If c=v; then ∆õ=h/mv
                    We also know the momentum of a particle, P= mv.
                    Hence, ∆õ=h/P.
                    </h3>Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle/<h3>
                         Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle states that both the momentum and position of a particle
                         cannot be determined
                         simultaneously.
                         Mathematically, it can be expressed as ‚àÜ x ‚àÜP ‚â• (h / 4œÄ) where ‚àÜx represents the Uncertainty in
                         position, ‚àÜP
                         represents the Uncertainty in Momentum.
                         <h3>Planck‚Äôs Quantum Theory</h3>
                         When we apply heat to a black body, it results in the emission of thermal radiations having
                         different wavelengths
                         or frequency. As such Max Planck put forward a theory called Planck‚Äôs Quantum Theory to explain
                         these radiations.
                         The main highlights of the theory include:
                         <ul>
                              <li>Substances absorb or radiate energy in a discontinuous manner. This process takes
                                   place in the form of
                                   small packets. </li>
                              <li>The above-said process takes place in whole-number multiples of quantum as hf, 2hf,
                                   3hf‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nhfs; where n is
                                   a positive integer. </li>
                              <li>The smallest packet of energy is called Quantum. It is referred to as Photon in case
                                   of Light. </li>
                              <li>The energy of a Quantum is directly proportional to the radiation frequency. </li>
                              <h3>Electron Under An Electric Field</h3>
                              Consider an electron of mass m, with a charge q being accelerated through a potential V
                              from rest. The kinetic
                              energy K of the electron equals the work done on it by the electric field which equals to
                              qV.
                              K = qV = ¬Ω mv2 = P2/2m
                              P = ‚àö 2mK = ‚àö 2mqV
                              The de Broglie wavelength ∆õ of the electron is given by;
                              ∆õ = h / P = h / ‚àö2mK = h / ‚àö2mqV
                              Substituting the numerical values of h, m and e; we have ∆õ=1.227/ nm; where V is the
                              magnitude of accelerating
                              potential in Volts.
