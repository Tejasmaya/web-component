                    What is telescope ?,
               </b>
               A telescope is an instrument that is used to view distant objects. If you want to look at the planets,
               you can use a
               telescope. The higher the magnification on the telescope, the better your view will be.
               <br>

          </p>
          <p><b>how it works?

               </b>
               The lens in the front of the telescope, called the objective lens, produces an upside-down image of the
               object one is
               using the telescope to look at. The lens near the eye, called the eye lens, acts as an ordinary
               magnifying glass to
               magnify that upside-down image. This is the basic principle of the telescope.
               <br>
          </p>
          <p><b>

               </b>
               There are two basic types of telescopes, refracting and reflecting. Refracting telescopes use lenses to
               focus the light,
               and reflecting telescopes use mirrors.
               Refracting telescopes work by using two lenses to focus the light and make it look like the object is
               closer to you than
               it really is. Both lenses are in a shape that’s called 'convex'. Convex lenses work by bending light
               inwards.
               Reflecting telescopes, on the other hand, don’t use lenses at all. Instead, they use mirrors to focus the
               light
               together. In this case, the type of mirror that they use is a concave mirror. Mirrors of this shape also
               accomplish the
               goal of bending light together, except that they do it by reflecting the light instead of bending it as
               it passes
               through

          <p><b> Our Solar System


               </b>
               The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The Solar
               System formed
               4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.</p>
          <p>
               While we think of the Solar System as an enormous structure in human terms, in astronomical terms, a
               solar system is
               very small. Although solar systems are not important to the overall structure of the Universe, the one in
               which we live
               is very important from a human perspective, and it will help us to set the scale by which we can
               understand larger
               cosmic constituents. We will therefore briefly discuss the objects that are contained in our Solar
               System:
          <ul>
               <li>The Sun</li>
               <li>The terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
               </li>
               <li>The gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
               </li>
               <li>The dwarf planets: Pluto, Eris, Makemake, Haumea, and Ceres
               </li>
               <li>The moons of the planets
               </li>
               <li>Comets, asteroids, other small bits of rock, dust, and gases
               </li>
          </ul>
          We have sent spacecraft and probes to many of these places. However, the only place that humans have traveled
          to beyond
          near-Earth orbit is the Moon.

          <p><b> Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation

                    <br>
               </b>
               What do aching feet, a falling apple, and the orbit of the Moon have in common? Each is caused by the
               gravitational
               force. Our feet are strained by supporting our weight—the force of Earth’s gravity on us. An apple falls
               from a tree
               because of the same force acting a few meters above Earth’s surface. And the Moon orbits Earth because
               gravity is able
               to supply the necessary centripetal force at a distance of hundreds of millions of meters. In fact, the
               same force
               causes planets to orbit the Sun, stars to orbit the center of the galaxy, and galaxies to cluster
               together. Gravity is
               another example of underlying simplicity in nature. It is the weakest of the four basic forces found in
               nature, and in
               some ways the least understood. It is a force that acts at a distance, without physical contact, and is
               expressed by a
               formula that is valid everywhere in the universe, for masses and distances that vary from the tiny to the
               immense.
               <br>
               Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it
               could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See Figure. But Newton was not the first to
               suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner Galileo
               Galilei had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton’s
               contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress
               toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to
               use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses,
               parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph—it had been known for some
               time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose a mechanism
               that caused them to follow these paths and not others.

               <br>
               According to early accounts, Newton was inspired to make the connection between falling bodies and
               astronomical motions
               when he saw an apple fall from a tree and realized that if the gravitational force could extend above the
               ground to a
               tree, it might also reach the Sun. The inspiration of Newton’s apple is a part of worldwide folklore and
               may even be
               based in fact. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of gravitation and his
               laws of motion
               answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying
               simplicity and unity in
               nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.
