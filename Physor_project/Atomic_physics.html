          <h2>Atom and nuclei</h2>

          <h3>What are Atoms?</h3>
          Atoms are made up of the same amount of negative and positive charges. In Thomson’s model, atoms were
          described as a
          spherical cloud of positive charges with embedded electrons. In Rutherford’s model, one tiny nucleus bears
          most of the
          mass of the atom along with its positive charges and the electrons revolve around it. Rutherford’s model
          didn’t fulfil
          two explanations.
          <ul>
               <li>It could not concur the stability of the matter as it foretells that atoms are unstable because of
                    the
                    electrons that revolve around the nucleus might spiral into the nucleus</li>.
               <li>It is unable to explain the spectral characteristics of a line of atoms. Atoms of every element emit
                    a specific
                    characteristics spectrum and are stable. The spectrum is made of line spectrum which is an isolated
                    parallel
                    line. </li>
          </ul>
          Thomson’s model has a defect of unstable electrostatically and Rutherford’s model is electromagnetically
          unstable.
          <h3>Line spectrum of the hydrogen atom</h3>
          A hydrogen atom is made up of multiple series of line spectrum which are:
          <ul>
               <li>Pfund Series</li>
               <li>Brackett Series</li>
               <li>Paschen Series</li>
               <li>Balmer Series</li>
               <li>Lyman Series</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What are the postulates of Bohr atomic model? </h3>
          Niels Bohr laid the foundations of quantum mechanics, those are:
          <ul>
               <li>The hydrogen’s atom electrons revolve around in stable orbits without emitting any radiant energy.
               </li>
               <li>IN the stationary orbits, the angular momentum is the multiple of the equation h/ 2π
                    , and L=nh/ 2π
                    where n is called the quantum number a. </li>
               <li>Electron makes the transition from a non-radiating orbit to another of lower energy. When this is
                    happening, a
                    photon gets emitted of the same energy as the difference between the final and the initial states.
                    The
                    frequency (v) is calculated by hv=Ei-Ef</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What is De Broglie’s Hypothesis? </h3>
          This states that the wavelength of electrons is λ=h/mv
          and the whole number of wavelengths is equal to the orbits circumferencing the main orbit corresponding to the
          circular
          standing waves.
          <h3>Frequently asked Questions Atoms</h3>
          <h3>What are ‘Alpha’ particles? </h3>
          Alpha particles are composite particles consisting of two protons and two neutrons tightly bound together.
          </h3>What does the ‘Balmer series’ refer to? </h3>
          The Balmer series is the name given to a series of spectral emission lines of the hydrogen atom that result
          from
          electron transitions from higher levels down to the energy level with principal quantum number 2.
          <h3>What is ‘de Broglie hypothesis’? </h3>
          De Broglie’s hypothesis of matter waves postulates that any particle of matter that has linear momentum is
          also a wave.

          <h3>Define the Nucleus? </h3>
          An atom consists of the nucleus which is positively charged. The atomic radius is larger than the nucleus’s
          radius. The
          mass of an atom is focused on the nucleus. The atom consists of neutrons which have the same mass as protons.
          The
          protons and neutrons are bound with each other with a nuclear force. The energies present in nuclear
          activities is much
          larger than that of a chemical process.
          <h3>Isotopes</h3>
          When the nuclides have the same number of atoms but a different number of neutrons then it is termed as
          isotopes.
          <h3>Radioactivity</h3>
          The nuclei of certain elements give out
          rays and each representing as helium nuclei, electrons and electromagnetic radiation respectively.
          Radioactivity is the
          sign of instability of the nuclei.
          </h3>Why fusion requires high temperature? </h3>
          The nuclei which are light must have sufficient initial energy to overpower the Coulombs law between
          electrical charges
          having a potential barrier which is only possible in high temperatures.
          <h3>Nature of Binding Energy</h3>
          This shows that nuclear reactions which are exothermic in nature are possible in which when a heavy nucleus
          undergoes
          fission or two lighter nuclei fuse together to form nuclei with medium mass.
          <h3>What is the density of nucleic matter? </h3>
          The mass density of an atoms does not make it capable of depending upon the size of the nucleus.
          <h3>Frequently asked Questions Nuclei</h3>
          <h3>What is an ‘Isotope’? </h3>
          Isotopes are members of a family of an element that all have the same number of protons but different numbers
          of
          neutrons.
          <h3>What is ‘Radioactivity’? </h3>
          Radioactivity is the act of emitting radiation spontaneously.
          <h3>What is ‘Binding energy’? </h3>
          The energy that holds a nucleus together is called the ‘Binding energy’. This is equal to the mass defect of
          the
          nucleus.
