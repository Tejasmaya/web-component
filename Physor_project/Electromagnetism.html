          <p><b id="elec">Electromagnetic Induction</b>
               <br>
               Electromagnetic Induction is a current produced because of voltage production (electromotive force) due
               to a changing
               magnetic field. This either happens when a conductor is placed in a moving magnetic field (when using an
               AC power
               source) or when a conductor is constantly moving in a stationary magnetic field.
               <br>
               Electromagnetic Induction is a current produced because of voltage production (electromotive force) due
               to a changing
               magnetic field
               <br>
               Electromagnetic induction has found many applications, including electrical components such as inductors
               and
               transformers, and devices such as electric motors and generators.
               <br>
               In Faraday's first experimental demonstration (August 29, 1831), he wrapped two wires around opposite
               sides of an iron
               ring or "torus" (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer).[citation needed] Based on his
               understanding
               of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would
               travel through the
               ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and
               watched it as
               he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a "wave of
               electricity", when he
               connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.[7] This induction was due to the
               change in
               magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.[
               <br>
               2] Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For
               example, he saw
               transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a
               steady (DC)
               current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's
               disk").[8]

               <br>
               Faraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called lines of force. However, scientists
               at the time
               widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically.[9] An
               exception was James
               Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic
               theory.[9][10][11] I
               <br>
               n Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential
               equation, which
               Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's
               original formulation
               and does not describe motional EMF. Heaviside's version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form
               recognized
               today in the group of equations known as Maxwell's equations.

          <p><b id="alc"> Alternating Current <br></b>
               Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its
               magnitude
               continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating
               current is the
               form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical
               energy that
               consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a
               wall socket. A
               common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used
               to mean simply
               alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.[1][2]
               <br>
               The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave, whose positive
               half-period
               corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa. The direction of the current may not
               actually reverse
               (as for the labeled pulsating waveform). In certain applications, like guitar amplifiers, different
               waveforms are used,
               such as triangular waves or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also
               examples of
               alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound (audio) or images
               (video)
               sometimes carried by modulation of an AC carrier signal. These currents typically alternate at higher
               frequencies than
               those used in power transmission.

               <br>
               High voltages have disadvantages, such as the increased insulation required, and generally increased
               difficulty in their
               safe handling. In a power plant, energy is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a
               generator, and then
               stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down
               to the voltages
               used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but
               generally motors and
               lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment
               such as lighting
               and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to
               operate.
               Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different mains power systems
               found in the
               world. High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as
               technology has
               provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. Transmission with high voltage direct
               current was not
               feasible in the early days of electric power transmission, as there was then no economically viable way
               to step down the
               voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.
               <br>
               Three-phase electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the
               generator
               stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three
               current
               waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are
               added opposite to
               these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired
               together. In
               practice, higher "pole orders" are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10°
               spacing). The
               advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a
               2-pole machine
               running at 3600 rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600 rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed
               is preferable
               for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current
               flows through
               the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed
               the highest of
               the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an
               oversized neutral
               bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause
               neutral conductor
               current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.

          <p><b id="emw"> Electromagnetic Waves <br></b>
               Mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves are two important ways that energy is transported in the world
               around us.
               Waves in water and sound waves in air are two examples of mechanical waves. Mechanical waves are caused
               by a disturbance
               or vibration in matter, whether solid, gas, liquid, or plasma. Matter that waves are traveling through is
               called a
               medium. Water waves are formed by vibrations in a liquid and sound waves are formed by vibrations in a
               gas (air). These
               mechanical waves travel through a medium by causing the molecules to bump into each other, like falling
               dominoes
               transferring energy from one to the next. Sound waves cannot travel in the vacuum of space because there
               is no medium to
               transmit these mechanical waves.
               <br>

          </p>
          <p>
               Electricity can be static, like the energy that can make your hair stand on end. Magnetism can also be
               static, as it is
               in a refrigerator magnet. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and
               vice-versa—the two are
               linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical
               waves in that
               they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only
               through air and
               solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.
               <br>
               Light is made of discrete packets of energy called photons. Photons carry momentum, have no mass, and
               travel at the
               speed of light. All light has both particle-like and wave-like properties. How an instrument is designed
               to sense the
               light influences which of these properties are observed. An instrument that diffracts light into a
               spectrum for analysis
               is an example of observing the wave-like property of light. The particle-like nature of light is observed
               by detectors
               used in digital cameras—individual photons liberate electrons that are used for the detection and storage
               of the image
               data.

                    POLARIZATION
                    <br>
               </b>
               One of the physical properties of light is that it can be polarized. Polarization is a measurement of the
               electromagnetic field's alignment. In the figure above, the electric field (in red) is vertically
               polarized. Think of a
               throwing a Frisbee at a picket fence. In one orientation it will pass through, in another it will be
               rejected. This is
               similar to how sunglasses are able to eliminate glare by absorbing the polarized portion of the light.

          </p>
          <p>
               The terms light, electromagnetic waves, and radiation all refer to the same physical phenomenon:
               electromagnetic energy.
               This energy can be described by frequency, wavelength, or energy. All three are related mathematically
               such that if you
               know one, you can calculate the other two. Radio and microwaves are usually described in terms of
               frequency (Hertz),
               infrared and visible light in terms of wavelength (meters), and x-rays and gamma rays in terms of energy
               (electron
               volts). This is a scientific convention that allows the convenient use of units that have numbers that
               are neither too
               large nor too small.
               <br>
               The number of crests that pass a given point within one second is described as the frequency of the wave.
               One wave—or
               cycle—per second is called a Hertz (Hz), after Heinrich Hertz who established the existence of radio
               waves. A wave with
               two cycles that pass a point in one second has a frequency of 2 Hz.
