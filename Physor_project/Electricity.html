               Electrostatics is a branch of physics that deals with the phenomena and properties of stationary or
               slow-moving electric
               charges. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert on each other and are
               described by
               Coulomb’s law. Even though electrostatically induced forces seem to be relatively weak.

                    <br>
               </b>
               We begin with the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges q and Q . It is
               convenient to label one
               of these charges, q , as a test charge, and call Q a source charge. As we develop the theory, more source
               charges will
               be added. If r is the distance between two charges, then the force of electrostatic formula is:
               F=kq <sub>1</sub>q <sub>2</sub>/r <sup>2</sup>

                    Electric field
                    <br>
               </b>
               Electric field lines help visualize the electric field. Field lines begin on a positive charge and
               terminate on a
               negative charge. Electric field lines are parallel to the direction of the electric field, and the
               density of these
               field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.

               </b>
               In these particles, the numbers of positive ions are larger than the numbers of negative ions. This means
               the numbers of
               protons are larger than the number of electrons. To neutralize positively charged particles, electrons
               from the
               surroundings come to this particle until the number of protons and electrons becomes equal.

               <br>
               Similarly numbers of electrons are larger than the number of protons. To neutralize negatively charged
               particles, since
               protons cannot move and cannot come to negatively charged particles, electrons move to the ground or any
               other particle

               Neutral particles include equal numbers of protons and electrons. They have both protons, neutrons and
               electrons;
               however, the numbers of positive ions equal the numbers of negative ions.

          </h2>
          <p>
               Current electricity is defined as the flow of electrons from one section of the circuit to another.

               <br>
               When two bodies at different potentials are linked with a wire, free electrons stream from Point 1 to
               Point 2, until
               both the objects reach the same potential, after which the current stops flowing. Until a potential
               difference is
               present throughout a conductor, current runs.
               <br>
               Electromotive Force Definition: Electromotive force is defined as the electric potential produced by
               either an
               electrochemical cell or by changing the magnetic field.

               <br>
               Voltage Definition: Voltage is defined as the electric potential difference between two points.

                    Direct Current

               </b>
               The current electricity whose direction remains the same is known as direct current. Direct current is
               defined by the
               constant flow of electrons from a region of high electron density to a region of low electron density. DC
               is used in
               many household appliances and applications that involve a battery.

                    <br>
               </b>
               The current electricity that is bidirectional and keeps changing the direction of the charge flow is
               known as
               alternating current. The bidirectionality is caused by a sinusoidally varying current and voltage that
               reverses
               directions, creating a periodic back and forth motion for the current. The electrical outlets at our home
               and industries
               are supplied with alternating current.

                    Electric potential
                    <br>
               </b>The electric potential (also called the electric field potential, potential drop, the electrostatic
               potential) is
               defined as the amount of work energy needed to move a unit of electric charge from a reference point to
               the specific
               point in an electric field. More precisely, it is the energy per unit charge for a test charge that is so
               small that the
               disturbance of the field under consideration is negligible. Furthermore, the motion across the field is
               supposed to
               proceed with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test charge acquiring kinetic energy or
               producing radiation. By
               definition, the electric potential at the reference point is zero units. Typically, the reference point
               is earth or a
               point at infinity, although any point can be used.
               <br>
          </p>
          <p>
               In classical electrostatics, the electrostatic field is a vector quantity that is expressed as the
               gradient of the
               electrostatic potential, which is a scalar quantity denoted by V or occasionally φ,[1] equal to the
               electric potential
               energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in joules) divided by the charge of that
               particle (measured in
               coulombs). By dividing out the charge on the particle a quotient is obtained that is a property of the
               electric field
               itself. In short, an electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

          </p>
          <p>
               Practically, the electric potential is always a continuous function in space. Otherwise, the spatial
               derivative of it
               will yield a field with infinite magnitude, which is practically impossible. Even an idealized point
               charge has 1 ⁄ r
               potential, which is continuous everywhere except the origin. The electric field is not continuous across
               an idealized
               surface charge, but it is not infinite at any point. Therefore, the electric potential is continuous
               across an idealized
               surface charge. An idealized linear charge has ln(r) potential, which is continuous everywhere except on
               the linear
               charge.

                    Capacitance
                    <br>
               </b>
               Capacitance is the ratio of the amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to a difference in
               electric potential.
               There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual
               capacitance.[1]: 237–238  Any object
               that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. In this case the electric potential
               difference is measured
               between the object and ground. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a
               given potential
               difference than one with low capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for
               understanding
               the operations of the capacitor, one of the three elementary linear electronic components (along with
               resistors and
               inductors). In a typical capacitor, two conductors are used to separate electric charge, with one
               conductor being
               positively charged and the other negatively charged, but the system having a total charge of zero. The
               ratio in this
               case is the magnitude of the electric charge on either conductor and the potential difference is that
               measured between
               the two conductors.
               <br>

          </p>
          <p>
               In electrical circuits, the term capacitance is usually a shorthand for the mutual capacitance between
               two adjacent
               conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor, there also exists
               a property
               called self capacitance, which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated
               conductor to raise its
               electric potential by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).[3] The reference point for
               this potential
               is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this
               sphere.
