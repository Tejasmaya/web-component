               Kinematics</h3>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>

               Kinematics is simply the study of motion. This is literally what the word means: kinesis (motion) + tics
               (the study of.
               Think mathematics, politics, pizzatics). On a more practical level, the kinematics you learn in your
               intro physics class
               is the study of position, velocity, and momentum. On the most practical level, kinematics is the study of
               what happens
               when you toss a ball. Which means, if you can toss a ball, you can learn kinematics ‚Äì FYI, as anyone who
               has ever seen
               me play sports knows, the reverse is not true.
          </p>
          <h4>


               POSITION:
          </h4>
          <p>

               Where an object is. It‚Äôs location. Physics problems will refer to this as x, y, z p, r, or d. Every
               teacher has their
               preferences, so learn yours, but for this blog we will use x and y. We are also often interested in the
               change in
               position, known as displacement, which is referred to as Œîx, Œîy, Œîp, Œîd or sometimes just x, y, or d to
               make things
               confusing. Position and displacement are usually measured in meters or m.
          </p>
          <h4>

               VELOCITY:
          </h4>
          <p>

               How fast an object is moving and in what direction: aka how the distance is changing over time. Physics
               problems will
               almost always refer to velocity as v. Velocity is usually measured in meters per second, or m/s. When
               velocity is
               constant, it can be described by the equation v=Œîx/Œît (the change in position divided by the change in
               time).
          </p>
          <h4>

               ACCELERATION:
          </h4>
          <p>

               How the velocity of the object is changing. If a Ferrari goes from 0 to 60mph in 2.4 seconds then it is
               accelerating. If
               it the driver freaks out and crashes into a wall that stops the car, then it has also accelerated.
               Acceleration is
               always referred to as a, and is measured in meters per second per second, or m/s2.
          </p>
          <p>

               When acceleration is constant, it can be is described by the equation a=Œîv/Œît (the change in position
               divided by the
               change in time). You might notice that this equation is very similar to the equation for velocity. That
               is not a
               coincidence: it reflects the vast underlying physics that determines everything in the world.

          <p>
               1.Aristotle‚Äôs view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is
               necessary in practice
               to counter the opposing force of friction.





          </p>
          <p>
               2.Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined
               planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton‚Äôs first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus:
               ‚ÄúEverybody
               continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some
               external force to
               act otherwise‚Äù. In simple terms, the First Law is ‚ÄúIf external force on a body is zero, its acceleration
               is zero‚Äù.

          </p>
          <p>
               3.Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) : p = mv

          </p>
          <p>
               4.Newton‚Äôs second law of motion : The
               rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the
               direction in which the
               force acts. Thus d dkk m t==pFa where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We
               set the
               constant of proportionality k = 1 in SI units. Then d dmt==pFa The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1
               kg m s-2. (a)The
               second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0) (b)It is a vector equation (c)It is
               applicable to a
               particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F is the total external force on the
               system and a is the
               acceleration of the system as a whole. (d)F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same
               point at that
               instant. That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the history of motion.

          </p>
          <p>
               5.Impulse is
               the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a
               large force acts
               for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is
               very short, one
               can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the
               impulsive force.

                    Definition and Mathematics of Work
                    <br>
               </b>
               <br>
               When a force acts upon an object to cause a displacement of the object, it is said that work was done
               upon the object. There are three key ingredients to work - force, displacement, and cause. In order for a
               force to qualify as having done work on an object, there must be a displacement and the force must cause
               the displacement. There are several good examples of work that can be observed in everyday life - a horse
               pulling a plow through the field, a father pushing a grocery cart down the aisle of a grocery store, a
               freshman lifting a backpack full of books upon her shoulder, a weightlifter lifting a barbell above his
               head, an Olympian launching the shot-put, etc. In each case described here there is a force exerted upon
               an object to cause that object to be displaced.

                    Work Equation
                    <br>

               </b>
               <br>
               Mathematically, work can be expressed by the following equation.

               W = F ‚Ä¢ d ‚Ä¢ cos Œò
               where F is the force, d is the displacement, and the angle (theta) is defined as the angle between the
               force and the displacement vector. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the above equation is the angle
               "theta." The angle is not just any 'ole angle, but rather a very specific angle. The angle measure is
               defined as the angle between the force and the displacement. To gather an idea of it's meaning, consider
               the following three scenarios.
               <br>
               Scenario A: A force acts rightward upon an object as it is displaced rightward. In such an instance, the
               force vector and the displacement vector are in the same direction. Thus, the angle between F and d is 0
               degrees.

               <br>
               Scenario B: A force acts leftward upon an object that is displaced rightward. In such an instance, the
               force vector and the displacement vector are in the opposite direction. Thus, the angle between F and d
               is 180 degrees.
               <br>

               Scenario C: A force acts upward on an object as it is displaced rightward. In such an instance, the force
               vector and the displacement vector are at right angles to each other. Thus, the angle between F and d is
               90 degrees.

                    Uniform Circular Motion
               </b>
               Anim'n of object undergoing UCMUniform circular motion can be described as the motion of an object in a
               circle at a constant speed. As an object moves in a circle, it is constantly changing its direction. At
               all instances, the object is moving tangent to the circle. Since the direction of the velocity vector is
               the same as the direction of the object's motion, the velocity vector is directed tangent to the circle
               as well. The animation at the right depicts this by means of a vector arrow.
               <br>

               An object moving in a circle is accelerating. Accelerating objects are objects which are changing their
               velocity - either the speed (i.e., magnitude of the velocity vector) or the direction. An object
               undergoing uniform circular motion is moving with a constant speed. Nonetheless, it is accelerating due
               to its change in direction. The direction of the acceleration is inwards. The animation at the right
               depicts this by means of a vector arrow.
               <br>
               The final motion characteristic for an object undergoing uniform circular motion is the net force. The
               net force acting upon such an object is directed towards the center of the circle. The net force is said
               to be an inward or centripetal force. Without such an inward force, an object would continue in a
               straight line, never deviating from its direction. Yet, with the inward net force directed perpendicular
               to the velocity vector, the object is always changing its direction and undergoing an inward
               acceleration.

                    What is Heat?

               </b>
               Consider a very hot mug of coffee on the countertop of your kitchen. For discussion purposes, we will say
               that the cup
               of coffee has a temperature of 80¬∞C and that the surroundings (countertop, air in the kitchen, etc.) has
               a temperature
               of 26¬∞C. What do you suppose will happen in this situation? I suspect that you know that the cup of
               coffee will
               gradually cool down over time. At 80¬∞C, you wouldn't dare drink the coffee. Even the coffee mug will
               likely be too hot
               to touch. But over time, both the coffee mug and the coffee will cool down. Soon it will be at a
               drinkable temperature.
               And if you resist the temptation to drink the coffee, it will eventually reach room temperature. The
               coffee cools from
               80¬∞C to about 26¬∞C. So what is happening over the course of time to cause the coffee to cool down? The
               answer to this
               question can be both macroscopic and particulate in nature.

                    Another Definition of Temperature
                    <br>
               </b>
               Both of these scenarios could be summarized by two simple statements. An object decreases its temperature
               by releasing energy in the form of heat to its surroundings. And an object increases its temperature by
               gaining energy in the form of heat from its surroundings. Both the warming up and the cooling down of
               objects works in the same way - by heat transfer from the higher temperature object to the lower
               temperature object. So now we can meaningfully re-state the definition of temperature. Temperature is a
               measure of the ability of a substance, or more generally of any physical system, to transfer heat energy
               to another physical system. The higher the temperature of an object is, the greater the tendency of that
               object to transfer heat. The lower the temperature of an object is, the greater the tendency of that
               object to be on the receiving end of the heat transfer.

               <br>
               But perhaps you have been asking: what happens to the temperature of surroundings? Do the countertop and
               the air in the kitchen increase their temperature when the mug and the coffee cool down? And do the
               countertop and the air in the kitchen decrease its temperature when the can and its pop warm up? The
               answer is a resounding Yes! The proof? Just touch the countertop - it should feel cooler or warmer than
               before the coffee mug or pop can were placed on the countertop. But what about the air in the kitchen?
               Now that's a little more difficult to present a convincing proof of. The fact that the volume of air in
               the room is so large and that the energy quickly diffuses away from the surface of the mug means that the
               temperature change of the air in the kitchen will be abnormally small. In fact, it will be negligibly
               small. There would have to be a lot more heat transfer before there is a noticeable temperature change.
