               It was hard to believe for a very long time that there existed a relationship between electricity and
               magnetism! Hans
               Christian Oersted’s observation made a discovery demonstrating a close relationship between the two.
               Oersted observed a
               pivoted magnet was deflected when kept in the neighbourhood of a wire carrying electric current.
               <br>
               The work of Oersted thus demonstrated that magnetic effects could be produced by moving electrical
               charges. The branch
               of physics which deals with magnetism due to the electric current is called electromagnetism.

               Magnets have always been a mystery to us. They are a fun manipulative. At some orientation, they would
               pull each other
               towards themselves and at some, they would move away from each other. Over the years we learnt that the
               force that works
               behind this behaviour of magnets is its Magnetic Force which is attractive or repulsive in nature
               depending on its
               orientation with other magnets.

                    Magnetic Force
                    <br>
               </b>
               Magnetic Force can be defined as the attractive or repulsive force that is exerted between the poles of a
               magnet and electrically charged moving particles.
               <br>
               We have seen that the interaction between two charges can be considered in two stages. The charge Q, the
               source of the
               field, produces an electric field E. A charge q interacts with this field and experiences a force F.

               The Magnetic Field Interactive allows a learner to explore the magnetic field surrounding a simple bar
               magnet. A compass
               can be dragged about in the space surrounding the bar magnet and the effect of the magnet on the compass
               needle can be
               observed.
          </p>
          <p>
               The Magnetic Field is the space around a magnet or current carrying conductor around which magnetic
               effects can be
               experienced. Furthermore, it is a vector quantity and its SI unit is Tesla (T).

               <br>
               The formula for this is a closed loop integral. The integral of magnetic field density (B) along an
               imaginary closed
               path is equal to the product of current enclosed by the path and permeability of the medium. Line
               integral to the
               magnetic field of the coil = μo times the current passing through it.

               We all know that magnetic field is produced by the motion of electric charges or electric current.
               Biot-Savart law gives
               this relation between current and magnetic field. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude,
               direction, length, and
               proximity of the electric current.

                    Biot-Savart Law
                    <br>
               </b>
               A small current carrying conductor of length dl, carrying a current I is an elementary source of magnetic
               field. The
               force on another similar conductor can be expressed conveniently in terms of magnetic field dB due to the
               first. The
               dependence of magnetic field dB on the current I, on size and orientation of the length element dl and on
               distance r was
               first guessed by Biot and Savart.
          </p>
          <p>
               The Biot-Savart’s law gives the magnetic field produced due to a current carrying segment. This segment
               is taken as a
               vector quantity known as the current element.

               Consider a wire carrying a current I in a specific direction as shown in the figure. Take a small element
               of the wire of
               length dl. The direction of this element is along that of the current so that it forms a vector Idl. If
               we want to know
               the magnetic field produced at a point due to this small element, then we can use the Biot-Savart’s Law.

                    Similarities And Differences Between Biot-Savart Law And Coulomb’s Law

               </b>
               Both magnetic and electric fields at a point are inversely proportional to the square of the distance
               between the field
               source and the point in question.
               <br><br>
               The source of the electrostatic field is scalar in nature. Whereas, the source of the magnetic field,
               which is the
               current element (Idl), is a vector in nature. <br>
               The electric field always acts along the plane containing distance (r) between a point charge and the
               point where the
               electric field is to be calculated. But, the magnetic field acts in the plane perpendicular to the plane
               of distance(r)
               between the current element and the concerned point. <br>
               Magnetic field depends on both the angle (θ) between the current element (Idl) and the line joining the
               point and
               current element. However, the electric field doesn’t depend on the angle (θ).
